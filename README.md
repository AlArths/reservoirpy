A simple and flexible code for Reservoir Computing architectures like Echo State Networks

## Quick try
#### Chaotic timeseries prediction (MackeyGlass)
Run and analyse these two files to see how to make timeseries prediction with Echo State Networks:
- simple_example_MackeyGlass.py (using the ESN class)
- minimalESN__modified_enhanced03.py (without the ESN class)
